# Presentation tools

## Winner

**Remark it is the winner**. Markdown is easier to write than html where i need to write the tags and such.

I can still use CSS if i want to. And the feature set is just enough for a quick and dirty presentation.

Slidev is really impressive in capabilities but for me this type of tool is about convenience and simplicity. If i need something fancy I will use powerpoint lol.
